Key findings reveal seasonal sales peaks, specific time frames with high revenue potential, and insights into customer preferences that favor group dining and certain product categories. The analysis also highlights underperforming time slots and products, offering clear opportunities for improvement. Through targeted recommendations, such as optimizing pricing strategies, adjusting operational hours, and refining the menu, this report aims to guide the business towards more efficient and profitable operations.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the [data_pizza.xlsx](data_pizza.xlsx)

## Objective

The primary purpose of this report is to provide actionable insights and recommendations that will help the business maximize revenue, optimize operations, and refine its product offerings. This analysis focuses on identifying areas for improvement, such as adjusting operational hours, refining the menu, implementing dynamic pricing strategies, and utilizing promotional efforts during high-demand periods. The report aims to support decision-making and guide the business in aligning its strategies with customer preferences and peak sales periods to ensure sustained growth and operational efficiency.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging data preparation, modeling, and DAX calculations. The key steps included:

1. Data Preparation: Data was sourced, cleaned, and transformed to ensure accuracy.

2. Data Modeling & ERD: Relationships between tables were established, creating a clear structure to link tables together as seen in [pizza_ERD](pizza_ERD.png)

3. DAX Calculations: Key metrics like total sales, product performance, peak times, and ingredient usage were calculated using DAX. For example, measures were created to identify peak sales periods, rank products, and calculate ingredient usage.

4. Power BI Dashboards: Interactive visualizations were created to explore sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior, with dynamic filtering options for deeper insights.

5. Interpretation and Insights: Data-driven insights were drawn to identify trends, such as peak sales times, popular products, and customer preferences, revealing opportunities for growth and optimization.

6. Recommendations: Based on the findings, strategic recommendations were made, including optimizing pricing, refining the product menu, adjusting operational hours, and leveraging cross-selling opportunities to maximize revenue.

## Key Findings
- Sales Trends: Revenue peaks occur in July and November, driven by holidays, while Sundays and Mondays consistently underperform. Sales are highest between 11 AM–1 PM and 5 PM–7 PM.

- Product Performance: Supreme and Classic pizzas are the top performers, while products like Big Meat S and Brie Carre show potential for expansion into additional sizes.

- Customer Behavior: Evening sales are dominated by multi-orders, suggesting a preference for group dining, while individual pizzas perform well at lunchtime.

- Ingredient Usage: Garlic, tomatoes, and red onions are the most frequently used ingredients, indicating their importance in the menu. Pizzas with 5–6 ingredients tend to perform best.

- Cross-Selling Opportunities: Products like Big Meat S pair well with larger pizzas, offering opportunities for effective cross-selling.

## How to run code
1. Load the Dataset: Import the dataset by loading the [file](data_pizza.xlsx)
2.  Loading the dashboard (pbix file) in Power BI

## Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the following strategies should be prioritized:
1.	Operating Hours Optimization:
-	Focus on peak sales times (11 AM–1 PM, 5 PM–7 PM). Open slightly earlier on Fridays, Saturdays, and holidays (10:30 AM). Reevaluate closures on Mondays and low-sales Sundays.
-	Preparing ingredients and staff at peak times and specific busy days.
-	Investigate local demographics to determine the relevance of closures for holidays like Yom Kippur. Adjust operations if significant customer demand exists during these periods.
2.	Menu Expansion:
-	Offer additional sizes for popular items like Big Meat and Brie Carre to meet customer preferences and boost sales.
3.	Marketing Strategies:
-	Promote large (L) pizzas in chicken, veggie, and supreme categories.
-	Use combo deals featuring top combinations (e.g., "Big Meat S + Four Cheese L") to attract group diners.
-	Enhance promotions for small (S) pizzas to appeal to individual diners.
4.	XL and XXL Sizes:
-	Analyse barriers for XL and XXL sizes in the classic category and explore introducing them in other categories.
5.	Price Testing:
-	Experiment with price elasticity for low-sales items like Hawaiian or high-sales, low-quantity items like California Chicken to optimize pricing strategies.
-	Supreme and Veggie pizzas likely have inelastic demand, suggesting customers are less sensitive to price changes. These products may be perceived as premium or essential, sustaining consistent sales even at higher price points.
-	Marketing or promotional strategies could also explain the stable performance of Supreme and Veggie pizzas, even with price increases.
-	For Classic pizzas, pricing strategies should carefully consider the sensitivity to price, as both sales and quantities are negatively impacted by higher prices.
6.	Ingredient and Recipe Innovation:
-	Develop pizzas highlighting popular ingredients (garlic, tomatoes, red onions).
-	Focus on recipes with 5–6 ingredients for optimal sales performance.
7.	Operational Efficiency:
-	Streamline kitchen processes for peak times and train staff to handle individual and group orders effectively.
8.	Customer Engagement:
-	Introduce loyalty programs to incentivize repeat purchases and boost sales during slower periods.
9.	Holiday Adjustments: 
-	Review closures during holidays like Yom Kippur based on local demand.

By implementing these strategies, the business can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.
