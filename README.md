### B.	Product performance analysis
1.	Overview of Product Portfolio
-	Pizza Categories: Classic, Supreme, Chicken, Veggie
-	Number of Pizza Types: 32
-	Pizza Size-Types: 91 unique combinations
2.	Category Performance
-	Top Categories: The classic and supreme categories rank highest in both sales and quantity, with classic consistently leading across both metrics.
-	Chicken and Veggie: While chicken slightly outperforms veggie in sales, veggie surpasses chicken in terms of quantity sold, indicating balanced customer demand for both price and volume.
3.	Performance of 32 Pizza Types
-	High Sales, Low Quantity: Pizzas like California Chicken and Spicy Italian generate high sales but have relatively low quantity sold, suggesting a premium pricing strategy that appeals to a smaller, more targeted audience.
-	Low Sales, High Quantity: Hawaiian and Pepperoni are sold in large quantities but generate relatively lower sales. This could indicate customer preference for lower-priced, higher-volume pizzas.
4.	Pizza Size and Sales Performance:
-	General Trend: Large (L) pizzas dominate sales across categories, followed by medium (M) and small (S).
-	Category-Specific: Chicken, Veggie, and Supreme: L > M > S reflects a preference for sharing-sized options. Classic: Small (S) leads, followed by large (L), medium (M), XL, and XXL, suggesting individual or small-group consumption.
-	XL and XXL Sizes: Only available in the classic category, they underperform due to perceived value or portion size mismatch.

### C.	Customer purchase analysis
1.	Orders behaviour and peak time insights
-	Customers prefer multi-orders (61.6%) over single orders (38.4%), indicating that groups or families are a key customer segment
-	The restaurant experiences two distinct peak times, each with different customer behaviours:

    First Peak Time (e.g., lunch breaks): Single orders dominate, indicating that these customers are likely individuals looking for quick meals, such as during work or lunch breaks.
    
    Second Peak Time (e.g., evening family dinners): Multi-orders dominate, suggesting that group dining or family dinners are more common during this time, where customers order multiple pizzas to share.
2.	Pizza size preferences
-	From Small to Larger sizes (S, M, L) are the preferred choice across all 4 categories, indicating they are popular for group or sharing situations.
-	Bigger sizes (XL, XXL) in Classic underperforming. This may be due to perceived value or portion size mismatch for this pizza type.
3.	Performance of 91 Pizza Type-Size Combinations
-	Pizzas like Five cheese L, four cheese L and M, big meat S generate high sales but only has a few sizes. Get to know customers preference and their portion to add more size. Adding sizes might attract customers looking for personal portions or a lower price point. This could increase overall sales if there's demand for these sizes.
-	Pizza like Greek pizza with XXL has low sales but other sizes sales not bad. 
-	Green Garden pizza: Despite offering three sizes, Green Garden has weak overall sales. Focus efforts on promoting the size S, which leads in demand.
-	Brie Carre: Despite being available only in size S, it has achieved strong sales (~$11.6K). This suggests potential for expansion to larger sizes (M, L) to increase overall sales.
4.	Top 10 Common Pizza Combinations
-	Big Meat S consistently appears in the majority of top pizza combinations, indicates that customers are favouring it as a single pizza choice, especially when combined with larger-sized pizzas for group or family orders. However, Big Meat only has 1 size only, if it has more size then the revenue might increase since the demand is high. 
-	The consistent pairing of Big Meat S with larger pizzas (L and M sizes) suggests that customers often opt for a combination of individual servings (Big Meat S) along with larger pizzas for sharing.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the analysis has revealed several key opportunities to enhance business performance, focusing on optimizing pricing, refining the menu, and adjusting operations to align with customer demand. By implementing dynamic pricing for high-performing items and adjusting operating hours to focus on peak sales periods, the business can significantly increase revenue. Additionally, menu refinement and targeted customer promotions will help meet customer preferences and boost sales during slower periods.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following strategies should be prioritized:
1.	Operating Hours Optimization:
-	Focus on peak sales times (11 AM–1 PM, 5 PM–7 PM). Open slightly earlier on Fridays, Saturdays, and holidays (10:30 AM). Reevaluate closures on Mondays and low-sales Sundays.
-	Preparing ingredients and staff at peak times and specific busy days.
-	Investigate local demographics to determine the relevance of closures for holidays like Yom Kippur. Adjust operations if significant customer demand exists during these periods.
2.	Menu Expansion:
-	Offer additional sizes for popular items like Big Meat and Brie Carre to meet customer preferences and boost sales.
3.	Marketing Strategies:
-	Promote large (L) pizzas in chicken, veggie, and supreme categories.
-	Use combo deals featuring top combinations (e.g., "Big Meat S + Four Cheese L") to attract group diners.
-	Enhance promotions for small (S) pizzas to appeal to individual diners.
4.	XL and XXL Sizes:
-	Analyse barriers for XL and XXL sizes in the classic category and explore introducing them in other categories.
5.	Price Testing:
-	Experiment with price elasticity for low-sales items like Hawaiian or high-sales, low-quantity items like California Chicken to optimize pricing strategies.
-	Supreme and Veggie pizzas likely have inelastic demand, suggesting customers are less sensitive to price changes. These products may be perceived as premium or essential, sustaining consistent sales even at higher price points.
-	Marketing or promotional strategies could also explain the stable performance of Supreme and Veggie pizzas, even with price increases.
-	For Classic pizzas, pricing strategies should carefully consider the sensitivity to price, as both sales and quantities are negatively impacted by higher prices.
6.	Ingredient and Recipe Innovation:
-	Develop pizzas highlighting popular ingredients (garlic, tomatoes, red onions).
-	Focus on recipes with 5–6 ingredients for optimal sales performance.
7.	Operational Efficiency:
-	Streamline kitchen processes for peak times and train staff to handle individual and group orders effectively.
8.	Customer Engagement:
-	Introduce loyalty programs to incentivize repeat purchases and boost sales during slower periods.
9.	Holiday Adjustments: 
-	Review closures during holidays like Yom Kippur based on local demand.



Secondary recommendations that support long-term growth include:
- Discounts or Promotions for Low-Demand Days: Introduce discounts or bundle deals on Sundays and Mondays to boost sales during slower periods.
- Cross-Selling and Combo Deals: Offer meal bundles like “Big Meat S + Four Cheese L” to increase average order value.
- Customer Loyalty Program: Launch a rewards program to encourage repeat purchases, especially during low-sales periods.

By implementing these strategies, the business can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.
